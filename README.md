### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm currently building a Decentralized Finance product and can't wait to help bring some of the exciting products in the DeFi ecosystem to people who don't know where to start.

I love economics, philosophy, and thinking about the future. 

For those interested in what I've done, many of my more interesting projects must remain closed-source however some are open on here.
